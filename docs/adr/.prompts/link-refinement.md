Excellent! Let's analyze the linking within ${ADR Number}$ in a report!

The report should contain:

* A summary of the state of the ADR linking.
* A set of recommended actions that would improve ADR linking.

A few specific cases to look out for:

* Places where an ADR should be forward or backward referenced at the bottom of another ADR.
* Back/Next links for ADRs. These might be "←" and → hyperlinks.
* Links that could be made to external documentation, such as MDN, Node.js, or a module's documents.

Analayze the ADR and produce a report containing your recommendations for linking. Report your status in the chat, but do not include a summary in the chat log. Put that in the report.

Once you have finished your report, stop. I will review the report and we'll continue on. Keep me in the loop, please! :)

Excellent! Please add the content recommended by your report to ${ADR Number}$.
