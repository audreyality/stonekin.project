## About ADRs

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. Each ADR follows a structured format to ensure consistency and clarity in documenting the reasoning behind technical choices.

For more information about the ADR process, see [ADR-0000](./0000-architecture-decision-records.md).
