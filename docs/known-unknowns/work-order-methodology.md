# Work Order Methodology: Known Unknowns

## Overview

This document captures speculative concerns and uncertainties about the work order methodology that emerged during research but were excluded from the evaluation per project guidelines focusing on present-state assessment.

## Scalability Concerns

### Volume Scaling

- **Unknown**: How will the work order system perform with hundreds or thousands of work orders?
- **Considerations**: File system limitations, search/discovery challenges, potential need for indexing
- **Present mitigation**: Sequential numbering pattern designed for find-based research

### Team Scaling

- **Unknown**: How effectively will methodology transfer to multi-person teams?
- **Considerations**: Consistency across different practitioners, coordination between team member folders
- **Present approach**: Agent-based folders in work-item-log directory (e.g., `claudreyality/`, `audreyality/`)

## Long-Term Maintenance

### Archive Management

- **Unknown**: Optimal archive strategy as work orders accumulate over years
- **Considerations**: Balance between accessibility and storage, search performance degradation
- **Current approach**: Agent-based folder organization, no automated archival

### Decision Deprecation

- **Unknown**: How to handle outdated decisions that still have historical value
- **Considerations**: Confusion from obsolete guidance, maintaining decision lineage
- **Status tracking**: Lifecycle states proposed but not fully tested at scale

## Methodology Evolution

### Practice Refinement

- **Unknown**: How methodology will adapt to emerging practices and tools
- **Considerations**: Rigidity vs flexibility, backward compatibility of changes
- **Current state**: Evidence-based foundation allows iterative improvement

### Tool Integration

- **Unknown**: Integration requirements for future development tools
- **Considerations**: MCP server changes, new AI capabilities, automation opportunities
- **Present design**: File-based approach maximizes compatibility

## Edge Cases

### Cross-Domain Work Orders

- **Unknown**: Handling work orders spanning multiple domains or team members
- **Considerations**: Ownership clarity, documentation location, coordination overhead
- **Current approach**: Agent-specific folders with cross-references when needed

### Emergency Procedures

- **Unknown**: Methodology adaptation for time-critical decisions
- **Considerations**: Documentation depth vs response time, post-hoc documentation
- **Present assumption**: All work orders allow full methodology application

## External Dependencies

### LLM Evolution

- **Unknown**: Impact of changing AI capabilities on methodology effectiveness
- **Considerations**: Prompt compatibility, context window changes, new modalities
- **Design principle**: Human-readable documentation ensures longevity

### Tool Ecosystem

- **Unknown**: Dependency on specific tools (Git, markdown, file systems)
- **Considerations**: Platform portability, tool deprecation, format migrations
- **Mitigation**: Standard formats and minimal tool coupling

## Measurement and Validation

### Effectiveness Metrics

- **Unknown**: Quantitative measures of methodology success beyond subjective assessment
- **Considerations**: Decision quality metrics, time-to-decision tracking, outcome correlation
- **Current state**: Qualitative evaluation through rubric-based assessment

### Continuous Improvement

- **Unknown**: Systematic approach to methodology refinement based on outcomes
- **Considerations**: Feedback loops, retrospective processes, metric collection
- **Present approach**: Manual review and operator judgment

## Cultural and Organizational Factors

### Adoption Resistance

- **Unknown**: Barriers to methodology adoption in different organizational contexts
- **Considerations**: Perceived overhead, cultural fit, training requirements
- **Design goal**: Evidence-based practices increase adoption likelihood

### Knowledge Transfer

- **Unknown**: Effectiveness of methodology documentation for new practitioners
- **Considerations**: Learning curve, tacit knowledge gaps, mentorship needs
- **Current approach**: Comprehensive documentation with examples

## Technical Limitations

### Search and Discovery

- **Unknown**: Scalability of file-based search as repository grows
- **Considerations**: Performance degradation, need for indexing solutions
- **Present mitigation**: Structured naming conventions for find operations

### Version Control Integration

- **Unknown**: Handling of work directory files in different VCS workflows
- **Considerations**: Gitignore complexity, accidental commits, merge strategies
- **Current practice**: Strong warnings against committing work files

## Future Considerations

These unknowns don't invalidate the methodology but highlight areas for future investigation as the system matures and scales. The present-state focus of the methodology provides a solid foundation while maintaining flexibility for evolution based on empirical experience.
