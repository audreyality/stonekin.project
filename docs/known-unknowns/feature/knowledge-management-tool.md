# Knowledge Management Tool: From Work Item Methodology to SDK Feature

## Overview

The work item methodology research revealed sophisticated knowledge management disciplines that could be formalized into a rudimentary knowledge base tool within the Stonekin SDK. This analysis explored eight different approaches to persistent memory and structured decision-making, providing a foundation for building knowledge management capabilities.

## Core Components Identified

The research validated five evidence-based practices that form natural building blocks for a knowledge management system: proximity-based context scoping (intelligent information hierarchy), quantitative evaluation frameworks (structured decision rubrics), systematic option comparison (alternative analysis), complete decision trails (forensic documentation), and problem-driven methodology (context-first approach). These practices, combined with the external validation findings, suggest a clear architecture for knowledge tooling.

## Proposed Implementation

A Stonekin knowledge management facility could provide three primary capabilities. **Structured Decision Support** would offer rubric templates, systematic option comparison tools, and decision trail documentation with automatic cross-referencing. **Information Architecture** would implement proximity-based scoping with hierarchical context management, durable linking systems, and automated reference management. **Forensic Documentation** would maintain immutable work item logs, decision history tracking, and knowledge evolution trails with full attribution.

## Integration Approach

The tool would integrate naturally with existing Stonekin patterns by extending the memory systems already evaluated (Basic Memory, Memory-Plus, Neo4j), leveraging the established work directory patterns for local tooling, and connecting with ADR workflows for coordination needs. The proximity-based scoping principle could be implemented as intelligent context gathering, while the reference-style linking pattern could enable efficient token management for AI interactions.

## Research Foundation

The systematic evaluation of MCP memory servers provides concrete implementation paths, from lightweight markdown-based approaches (Basic Memory) to sophisticated graph databases (Neo4j, GraphRAG). The external validation research identified industry standards and academic frameworks that could guide feature development, ensuring the tool aligns with established knowledge management practices while serving the specific needs of AI-assisted development workflows.

The forensic nature of work item logs suggests a natural audit trail capability, while the team scaling through folder structures provides multi-user support. This combination of validated practices, proven technologies, and clear architectural patterns creates a strong foundation for developing knowledge management capabilities as a core Stonekin SDK feature.
