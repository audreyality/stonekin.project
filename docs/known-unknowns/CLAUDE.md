# Claude Code Instructions

This directory contains documentation and exploration files that are not part of the core codebase.

## Files to Ignore

Claude Code should ignore the following files in this directory when providing programming assistance:

- `ideas.md` - Brainstorming and ideation content
- `index.md` - Directory overview and navigation
- `repl.md` - Interactive exploration and experimentation notes

These files contain conceptual content, documentation, and exploratory work that would be better handled by general-purpose AI tools rather than specialized programming assistants.

When these files are edited, use tools that are more suited to general writing and documentation tasks rather than code-focused tools.
