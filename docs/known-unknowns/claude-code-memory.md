# Claude Code Memory Extension - Known Unknowns

## Overview

This document captures known unknowns related to extending Claude Code's memory capabilities through MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. Based on the evaluation of 8 MCP memory servers, we've identified a tiered growth path and critical questions that will inform future development.

## Selected Architecture: Tiered Memory System

### Current State: Basic Memory (Tier 1)

- **Implementation:** Markdown files with semantic patterns
- **Score:** 92.5% alignment with project values
- **Strengths:** Git-native, human-readable, zero dependencies

### Growth Path

```text
Tier 1: Basic Memory → Tier 2: Memory Server → Tier 3: Neo4j
        (Markdown)         (Runtime Graph)      (Full Graph DB)
```

## Critical Known Unknowns

### 1. Performance Thresholds

**When does Basic Memory hit performance limits?**

- At what file count does search become noticeably slow? (100? 1,000? 10,000?)
- What query patterns cause the most degradation?
- How do different file sizes affect performance?
- What's the impact of deeply nested directory structures?

**Measurement Strategy:**

- Implement performance benchmarks at various memory volumes
- Track query response times as memory grows
- Monitor Claude Code's responsiveness with large memory sets

### 2. Relationship Complexity Threshold

**When do implicit Markdown links become insufficient?**

- How many cross-references before graph traversal is needed?
- What relationship types can't be expressed in Markdown?
- When do bidirectional relationships become critical?
- How to handle many-to-many relationships elegantly?

**Indicators to Watch:**

- Frequency of "can't find related memory" incidents
- Time spent manually traversing links
- Need for relationship-based queries

### 3. Team Collaboration Scale

**At what team size does runtime indexing become essential?**

- How many concurrent memory authors before conflicts arise?
- When does memory discovery become a bottleneck?
- What collaboration patterns emerge with team growth?
- How to maintain memory quality with multiple contributors?

**Scaling Considerations:**

- Memory naming conventions at scale
- Review processes for memory additions
- Merge conflict patterns in memory files

### 4. Migration Complexity

**What's the actual effort to implement Tier 2?**

#### Technical Unknowns

- How to efficiently index Markdown into Memory Server's graph?
- What metadata extraction patterns work best?
- How to handle incremental updates vs full reindexing?
- What's the performance overhead of maintaining dual systems?

#### Operational Unknowns

- How to train team on graph concepts while keeping Markdown primary?
- What tooling is needed for debugging graph inconsistencies?
- How to validate graph accuracy against Markdown source?

### 5. Hybrid System Overhead

**What's the true cost of running multiple tiers?**

#### Performance Overhead

- Memory usage of running both systems
- CPU cost of keeping graph synchronized
- Network overhead if tiers communicate
- Startup time impact on development flow

#### Maintenance Overhead

- Complexity of troubleshooting dual systems
- Version compatibility between tiers
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Monitoring and alerting requirements

### 6. Query Pattern Evolution

**How will our query needs evolve?**

- What queries are impossible with current grep/find?
- Which queries would benefit most from graph traversal?
- What full-text search capabilities might we need?
- How important is fuzzy/semantic search?

**Query Categories to Track:**

- Relationship queries ("all memories related to X")
- Temporal queries ("memories from last sprint")
- Semantic queries ("memories about performance")
- Aggregate queries ("most referenced topics")

### 7. Integration Points

**How will memory integrate with other MCP servers?**

- Can memory servers share context effectively?
- How to prevent memory conflicts between servers?
- What's the protocol for memory handoff between tiers?
- How to maintain memory consistency across integrations?

### 8. Memory Quality Metrics

**How do we measure memory system effectiveness?**

- What defines a "good" memory?
- How to measure memory retrieval success rate?
- What's the impact on development velocity?
- How to track memory usage patterns?

**Potential Metrics:**

- Memory creation rate
- Memory retrieval frequency
- Query success rate
- Time to find relevant memory
- Memory update frequency

## Decision Triggers

### Tier 1 → Tier 2 Triggers

- [ ] Search operations taking >1 second regularly
- [ ] Spending >30 minutes/week on memory organization
- [ ] Need for relationship-based queries arising weekly
- [ ] Memory count exceeding 1,000 files
- [ ] Multiple team members managing memories

### Tier 2 → Tier 3 Triggers

- [ ] Graph queries taking >500ms regularly
- [ ] Need for complex graph algorithms (shortest path, etc.)
- [ ] Memory system becoming mission-critical
- [ ] Requiring ACID transactions for memory updates
- [ ] Need for professional monitoring/alerting

## Research Needed

1. **Benchmark Basic Memory at scale**
   - Create test harness with 10K+ memory files
   - Measure query performance patterns
   - Identify bottleneck operations

2. **Prototype Tier 2 Integration**
   - Build proof-of-concept Markdown→Graph indexer
   - Measure synchronization overhead
   - Test incremental update strategies

3. **Study team memory patterns**
   - How do teams naturally organize memories?
   - What naming conventions emerge?
   - What conflicts arise with growth?

4. **Evaluate alternative architectures**
   - Could vector search (Qdrant) serve as Tier 2 instead?
   - Would a search index (like Elasticsearch) be simpler?
   - Can we skip Tier 2 entirely with better tooling?

## Open Questions for Future Investigation

1. Should memories be versioned independently of code?
2. How to handle memory deprecation and cleanup?
3. What's the role of AI in memory curation?
4. Can memories be automatically generated from code changes?
5. How to balance memory detail vs. noise?
6. Should memories have expiration dates?
7. How to handle sensitive information in memories?
8. What's the disaster recovery strategy for memories?

## Success Criteria for Memory System

The memory system will be considered successful when:

- Developers naturally create memories without friction
- Finding relevant memories takes seconds, not minutes
- Memory quality improves code understanding
- Team can onboard new members using memories
- System scales without requiring architectural changes

## Next Steps

1. Implement Basic Memory with instrumentation for metrics
2. Establish baseline performance measurements
3. Create memory quality guidelines
4. Build simple tooling for memory analysis
5. Plan Tier 2 proof-of-concept timeline
