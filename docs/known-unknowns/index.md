# Known Unknowns

This directory contains forward-looking concepts, future roadmap items, and exploratory ideas for the Stonekin SDK. These documents represent areas where we have identified potential value but haven't yet fully defined the implementation details.

## Contents

- [Evolution Vision](./ideas.md) - Future agent concepts and SDK evolution
- [REPL Exploration](./repl.md) - Human interactive loop system exploration and future considerations

## Purpose

These documents serve to:

- Capture emerging ideas before they're lost
- Provide a reference for long-term vision and potential future directions
- Maintain awareness of the broader vision while focusing on current deliverables
- Enable informed decision-making about architectural directions

## Usage

When working on current features, refer to these documents to ensure alignment with the long-term vision. When new ideas emerge, consider whether they belong in this collection or warrant immediate action. These explorations should inform but not drive current development decisions.
