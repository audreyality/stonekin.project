# Evolution Vision

## Future Agent Concepts

As the Stonekin SDK matures, it will evolve through specialized agents that extend its cognitive and interactive capabilities.

### Stenographer Agent

* Records interactive sessions, serving as a persistent and queryable memory.
* Utilizes facilities like Elasticsearch to store and retrieve recorded interactions.

### Memory Agent as a Vision Board

* Acts as an adaptive memory, reflecting gestalt scoring and tracking conceptual drift.
* Provides agents with contextual awareness, enabling smarter, adaptive behaviors based on historical data.

### Future Possibilities

* Enhanced reactive recovery and self-repair mechanisms through self-recovery agents.
* Advanced context-sharing strategies, further refining the system's adaptability and responsiveness to dynamic environments.
