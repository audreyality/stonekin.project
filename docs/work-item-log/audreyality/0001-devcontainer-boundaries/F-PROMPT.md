# Phase-by-Phase Implementation Prompt

## Critical Implementation Guidelines

**NEVER IMPLEMENT THE ENTIRE PLAN AT ONCE.** Implementation must follow the precise phase-by-phase structure in `.work/E-PLAN.md`.

### Phase Location and Selection

1. **Read `.work/E-PLAN.md`** to see all available phases (0-8)
2. **Select the NEXT uncompleted phase** marked without "âœ… COMPLETED"
3. **Copy that specific phase section** into `.work/_SESSION.md` for focused work
4. **Gather relevant domain context** from applicable `_DOMAIN.md` files and add to `_SESSION.md`

### Current Priority

**Find and implement the next uncompleted phase from E-PLAN.md.**
