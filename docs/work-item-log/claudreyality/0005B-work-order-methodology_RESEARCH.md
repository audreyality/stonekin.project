# Work Order Methodology Research

## Research Objective

Systematically analyze all existing work orders using the evaluation rubric to identify effective practices and patterns for work order methodology documentation.

## Methodology

Using [Sequential Thinking](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#sequential-thinking) to apply the 6 evaluation criteria to each work order:
1. **Locality** - Information co-location and minimal cross-references
2. **Context Awareness** - Self-contained understanding
3. **Present-State Clarity** - Current comprehensibility and actionability
4. **Completeness** - Sufficient information for present-state decisions
5. **Accessibility** - Discoverability and navigability
6. **Project Values Alignment** - Embodies established principles

## Structural Patterns Observed

### File Usage Patterns

- **RUBRIC**: Only used in 0001 (memory work order)
- **RESEARCH**: Present in all work orders
- **REPORT**: Present in all work orders  
- **File sizes**: Vary significantly (1,851 to 19,389 bytes)

### Location Patterns

- **0001-0003**: Located in `docs/work-order/claude-code/`
- **0004**: Located in `docs/work-order/` (root level)

### Naming Patterns

- **Consistent format**: `NNNNX-topic_TYPE.md`
- **Chronological lettering**: A, B, C represent creation order within work order
- **Creation sequence**: Letters track temporal progression of work order development

- RUBRIC → RESEARCH → REPORT progression
- Explicit evaluation criteria established upfront
- Clear decision trail throughout process
- Quantitative scoring with justification

**2. Problem-Driven Analysis ([0003][0003a-research], [0004][0004a-research])**
- Clear problem statement establishing context
- Current-state analysis before solutions
- Present-focused approach to challenges

**3. Self-Contained Documentation (All)**
- Sufficient context provided within work order
- Minimal external dependencies for understanding
- Background information appropriate for audience

**4. Systematic Evaluation ([0001][0001b-research], [0004][0004a-research])**
- Structured analysis methodology
- Multiple options considered systematically
- Explicit criteria for comparison

### Structural Patterns

**File Usage Effectiveness**:
- **RUBRIC**: Highly effective when used (0001) - provides clear evaluation framework
- **RESEARCH**: Consistently valuable across all work orders
- **REPORT**: Essential for capturing decisions and outcomes

**Content Organization**:
- **Overview/Problem Statement**: Critical for context setting
- **Systematic Analysis**: More effective than ad-hoc investigation
- **Clear Conclusions**: Essential for actionable outcomes

**Location Patterns**:
- **Inconsistent location** (claude-code/ vs root) doesn't impact effectiveness
- **Flat structure** within locations works well for discovery
- **Sequential naming** provides clear ordering

### Promising Practices for External Research

**Practices scoring highest on rubric criteria**:
1. **Quantitative evaluation frameworks** (scoring rubrics)
2. **Problem-driven research methodology**
3. **Systematic option comparison**
4. **Complete decision trail documentation**
5. **Self-contained context provision**

These patterns warrant external research to validate against established practices in:
- Technical decision-making methodologies
- Research documentation standards
- Knowledge management frameworks
- Decision architecture patterns
