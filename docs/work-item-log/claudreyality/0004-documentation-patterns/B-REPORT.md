# Documentation Pattern Generalization Implementation Report

## Work Order Summary

Successfully established comprehensive documentation patterns across the Stonekin project with clear boundaries between universal, root-level, and domain-specific patterns.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Pattern Hierarchy Established

**Universal Patterns (Apply Everywhere):**
- Memory files (`filename.memory`) for configuration context
- Work directory (`.work/`) for analysis and decision tracking

**Root-Level Patterns (Exclude /code and /memory):**
- `_DOMAIN.md` for architectural documentation
- `README.md` guidelines for non-code contexts
- General documentation principles

**Domain-Specific Patterns:**
- `/code` maintains independent standards in `code/CLAUDE.md`
- `/memory` exclusively managed by Basic Memory tool

### 2. Memory Systems Clarification

**Memory Files:**
- Source-controlled configuration context
- Apply throughout entire repository
- Example: `.markdownlint.json.memory`

**Memory Tool:**
- Non-source-controlled working knowledge
- Accessible only in dev container
- Contains relationships, API excerpts, early ideas, personal context

### 3. Operator Relationship Documentation

- Established "operator" as term for person prompting Claude
- Defined co-creator collaborative relationship
- Documented operator responsibilities for external LLM prompts

### 4. Work Directory System Enhancement

**Complete file type documentation:**
- `_RESEARCH.md` - Analysis and evidence gathering
- `_RUBRIC.md` - Evaluation criteria (complex decisions only)
- `_PROMPT.md` - External LLM prompts (operator executes)
- `_REPORT.md` - Implementation outcomes
- `_SESSION.md` - Decision tracking within work order
- `_REMEMBER.md` - Long-term memory outside dev container

**Added _REMEMBER.md callouts:**
- WARNING: Do not delete, only edit
- IMPORTANT: Long-term memory outside container

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files

- `.work/CLAUDE.md` - Comprehensive work directory guide
- `.work/_SESSION.md` - This work order's decision tracking
- `.work/_RESEARCH.md` - Documentation pattern analysis

### Modified Files

- Root `CLAUDE.md` - Added 4 new sections:
  - Operator Relationship
  - Memory Systems
  - Documentation Patterns (with scope exclusions)
  - Expanded Work Directory section
- `code/CLAUDE.md` - Added header clarification
- `.work/_REMEMBER.md` - Added documentation patterns section

## Pattern Scope Validation

### Clear Boundaries Established

- **Universal**: Memory files and work directory apply everywhere
- **Root-scoped**: Documentation patterns exclude `/code` and `/memory`
- **Code-specific**: `code/CLAUDE.md` remains authoritative for `/code`
- **Tool-managed**: `/memory` exclusively managed by Basic Memory tool

### No Duplication Confirmed

- Root CLAUDE.md focuses on project-wide patterns
- Code CLAUDE.md maintains independent domain standards
- Universal patterns acknowledged in both contexts
- Clear cross-references established

## Operator Integration

Successfully documented the collaborative relationship:
- Co-creator model with mutual input
- Claude provides analysis and implementation
- Operator provides context, guidance, and external execution
- External LLM prompts handled by operator

## Quality Assurance

### Cross-Reference Validation

- Root CLAUDE.md properly scopes patterns
- Code CLAUDE.md maintains independence with universal pattern acknowledgment
- Work directory documentation comprehensive
- Memory systems distinction clear

### Pattern Coverage

- ✅ All universal patterns documented
- ✅ Root-level patterns scoped correctly
- ✅ Domain-specific boundaries respected
- ✅ Memory systems distinguished
- ✅ Operator relationship established

## Success Metrics Met

- [x] Three-tier pattern system (Universal, Root-scoped, Domain-specific)
- [x] Operator as co-creator relationship established
- [x] Memory files vs. memory tool purposes distinguished
- [x] Comprehensive work directory documentation
- [x] No ambiguity about which patterns apply where
- [x] Clear exclusion of `/code` and `/memory` from root patterns

## Future Maintenance

The established pattern system provides:
- Clear decision framework for new documentation
- Scalable approach for additional directories
- Maintainable boundaries between contexts
- Collaborative workflow with operator integration

## Conclusion

The documentation pattern generalization successfully creates a comprehensive, scalable system that respects domain boundaries while enabling effective collaboration between Claude and operator. The three-tier approach (Universal, Root-scoped, Domain-specific) provides clarity without overlap or ambiguity.
