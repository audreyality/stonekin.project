# Work Order Evaluation Rubric

## Purpose

This rubric evaluates work order practices using present-state criteria aligned with project values. It focuses on current effectiveness rather than speculative concerns.

## Evaluation Scope

**INCLUDED IN EVALUATION:**
- Content organization and clarity
- Decision documentation quality
- Information accessibility
- Context preservation
- Project values alignment
- Present-state effectiveness

**EXPLICITLY EXCLUDED:**
- File naming convention (`NNNNX-topic_TYPE.md` - protected for find-based indexing research)
- Time-based metrics (duration, speed, long-term efficiency)
- Speculative concerns (document as known-unknowns instead)
- Hypothetical future complexity or scalability

## Evaluation Criteria

### 1. Locality

**Definition:** Information and decisions are co-located with relevant context

**Excellent:**
- Decisions documented near implementation
- Context available where decisions are made
- Minimal external dependencies
- Self-contained reasoning

**Good:**
- Most context co-located
- Few justified external references
- Clear connection between decisions and context

**Adequate:**
- Basic co-location present
- Some unnecessary cross-references
- Context mostly accessible

**Poor:**
- Information scattered across multiple locations
- Heavy reliance on external context
- Decisions separated from reasoning

### 2. Context Awareness

**Definition:** Information is understandable without requiring external knowledge

**Excellent:**
- Self-contained understanding possible
- Assumptions made explicit
- Background information provided
- Clear problem statements

**Good:**
- Generally self-contained
- Most assumptions documented
- Adequate background provided

**Adequate:**
- Basic context provided
- Some assumptions left implicit
- Requires minor external knowledge

**Poor:**
- Requires significant external context
- Assumptions hidden or unclear
- Insufficient background information

### 3. Present-State Clarity

**Definition:** Content is comprehensible and actionable in current conditions

**Excellent:**
- Clear, unambiguous language
- Actionable recommendations
- Appropriate for current complexity
- Easy to follow reasoning

**Good:**
- Generally clear communication
- Mostly actionable guidance
- Suitable for current context

**Adequate:**
- Understandable with effort
- Some actionable elements
- Generally appropriate complexity

**Poor:**
- Unclear or confusing content
- Non-actionable recommendations
- Inappropriate complexity level

### 4. Completeness

**Definition:** Sufficient information provided for present-state decision-making

**Excellent:**
- All necessary information present
- Multiple perspectives considered
- Evidence supports conclusions
- Gaps acknowledged explicitly

**Good:**
- Most necessary information present
- Key perspectives included
- Generally well-supported conclusions

**Adequate:**
- Basic information provided
- Main perspectives covered
- Adequate support for conclusions

**Poor:**
- Critical information missing
- Limited perspectives
- Insufficient evidence or reasoning

### 5. Accessibility

**Definition:** Information is discoverable and navigable in current context

**Excellent:**
- Clear structure and organization
- Logical information flow
- Easy navigation
- Appropriate level of detail

**Good:**
- Well-organized content
- Generally logical flow
- Mostly easy to navigate

**Adequate:**
- Basic organization present
- Followable structure
- Reasonable navigation

**Poor:**
- Poor organization
- Confusing structure
- Difficult to navigate

### 6. Project Values Alignment

**Definition:** Practices embody established project principles

**Excellent:**
- Fully embodies locality principles
- Demonstrates context awareness
- Maintains present-state focus
- Exemplifies project values

**Good:**
- Generally aligns with project values
- Minor deviations from principles
- Mostly appropriate approach

**Adequate:**
- Basic alignment with values
- Some inconsistencies
- Generally acceptable approach

**Poor:**
- Conflicts with project values
- Ignores established principles
- Inappropriate for project context

## Application Guidelines

### Evaluation Process

1. Read work order completely
2. Apply each criterion systematically
3. Note specific examples supporting ratings
4. Identify patterns across criteria
5. Document overall assessment

### Handling Speculative Concerns

When encountering future-focused or speculative elements:
- Note them separately as known-unknowns
- Do not penalize in present-state evaluation
- Consider documenting in appropriate known-unknowns location

### Constraints Recognition

- File naming convention is not subject to evaluation
- Time-based concerns should be excluded from scoring
- Focus on current cognitive load and complexity

## Expected Outcomes

This rubric should help identify:
- Practices that work well in current context
- Areas for present-state improvement
- Patterns worth preserving or changing
- Elements to include in methodology documentation
