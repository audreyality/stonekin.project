# Working Memory System Evaluation Rubric

## Overview

This rubric evaluates working memory systems for the Stonekin project using a weighted scoring methodology that prioritizes simplicity, local deployment, and integration with existing tooling.

## Scoring Methodology

- **Scale:** 1-5 points per criterion (1=Poor, 2=Below Average, 3=Average, 4=Good, 5=Excellent)
- **N/A:** When data cannot be determined, mark as N/A and exclude from scoring calculation
- **Weighting:** Criteria are weighted based on project priorities
- **Final Score:** (Sum of weighted scores) / (Sum of maximum possible weighted scores for evaluated criteria) × 100

## Evaluation Criteria

### High Priority Criteria (3x Weight)

#### 1. Setup Simplicity

How easy is initial installation and configuration?

- **5 - Excellent:** Single npm install, zero configuration required
- **4 - Good:** npm install + simple config file
- **3 - Average:** Multiple steps, clear documentation
- **2 - Below Average:** Complex setup, multiple dependencies
- **1 - Poor:** Difficult setup, unclear documentation

#### 2. Local/Self-hosted

Performs well locally with optional scaling to external services?

- **5 - Excellent:** Full local capability with seamless external scaling options (good performance up to ~1TB locally)
- **4 - Good:** Strong local performance with external scaling available when needed
- **3 - Average:** Adequate local performance, external services provide meaningful enhancements
- **2 - Below Average:** Limited local capability, external services required for reasonable performance
- **1 - Poor:** Poor local performance, essentially requires external services (upsell model)

#### 3. Integration with Existing Tools

How well does it integrate with Claude Code, Node.js, and existing toolchain?

- **5 - Excellent:** Native integration, works seamlessly with existing tools
- **4 - Good:** Good integration with minor adjustments needed
- **3 - Average:** Integrates with some configuration changes
- **2 - Below Average:** Requires significant toolchain modifications
- **1 - Poor:** Poor integration, conflicts with existing tools

### Medium Priority Criteria (2x Weight)

#### 4. Performance

Read/write speed, memory usage, and startup time?

- **5 - Excellent:** Sub-millisecond operations, low memory footprint
- **4 - Good:** Fast operations, reasonable resource usage
- **3 - Average:** Acceptable performance for typical usage
- **2 - Below Average:** Noticeable delays, higher resource usage
- **1 - Poor:** Slow operations, high resource consumption

#### 5. Data Format Readability

Is the stored data human-readable and version controllable?

- **5 - Excellent:** Plain text, git-friendly, easily debuggable
- **4 - Good:** Structured text format, mostly readable
- **3 - Average:** Readable with tools, some git compatibility
- **2 - Below Average:** Binary format, requires special tools
- **1 - Poor:** Opaque format, version control unfriendly

#### 6. Maintenance Overhead

Backup, updates, troubleshooting complexity?

- **5 - Excellent:** Zero maintenance, self-contained
- **4 - Good:** Minimal maintenance, simple backup
- **3 - Average:** Standard maintenance requirements
- **2 - Below Average:** Regular maintenance needed
- **1 - Poor:** High maintenance overhead

### Standard Priority Criteria (1x Weight)

#### 7. Query Capabilities

Search, filtering, and relationship handling?

- **5 - Excellent:** Full-text search, complex queries, relationships
- **4 - Good:** Good search capabilities, basic relationships
- **3 - Average:** Simple search and filtering
- **2 - Below Average:** Limited query capabilities
- **1 - Poor:** Basic key-value lookup only

#### 8. Scalability

Handles growing datasets and usage patterns?

- **5 - Excellent:** Scales to large datasets without degradation
- **4 - Good:** Handles expected growth well
- **3 - Average:** Adequate for current and near-term needs
- **2 - Below Average:** May struggle with significant growth
- **1 - Poor:** Limited scalability

#### 9. Security & Privacy

Data protection and access control?

- **5 - Excellent:** Strong encryption, granular access control
- **4 - Good:** Good security features, reasonable access control
- **3 - Average:** Basic security, file-system level protection
- **2 - Below Average:** Limited security features
- **1 - Poor:** Minimal security considerations

## Evaluation Process

For each working memory option:

1. **Research** the technology thoroughly
2. **Score** each criterion (1-5) with detailed rationale
3. **Calculate** weighted score using priority multipliers
4. **Document** specific evidence supporting each score
5. **Identify** pros/cons in Stonekin project context
6. **Consider** integration scenarios and implementation effort

## Scoring Calculation

```text
Weighted Score = (
  (Setup × 3) + (Local × 3) + (Integration × 3) +
  (Performance × 2) + (Format × 2) + (Maintenance × 2) +
  (Query × 1) + (Scalability × 1) + (Security × 1)
) / 21 × 100

Maximum possible score: 105 points
Percentage score: (Actual Score / 105) × 100
```

## Decision Framework

- **90-100%:** Excellent fit, immediate implementation candidate
- **80-89%:** Good fit, minor concerns to address
- **70-79%:** Acceptable fit, significant trade-offs
- **60-69%:** Poor fit, major limitations
- **Below 60%:** Not recommended for Stonekin project

## Project-Specific Considerations

- **Repository as Truth:** Memory complements but doesn't replace git repository
- **Session Continuity:** Must persist between Claude Code sessions
- **No Lock-in:** Easy data migration between systems if needed
- **Node.js Ecosystem:** Prefer solutions that integrate naturally with npm
- **Debugging:** Memory system should be inspectable by humans
- **Time to First Commit:** Setup should not significantly impact development velocity
