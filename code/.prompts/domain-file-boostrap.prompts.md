# Domain Bootstrap Script

We're bootstrapping a new domain together - a collaborative dance between human intuition and agent pattern recognition. This is autopoiesis in action: defining a system that will eventually define itself.

## Phase 1: Initial Perception (5 minutes max)

Let's tune into [MODULE_NAME]'s frequency. What patterns are emerging?

1. **Core Purpose**: What feedback loop does this module create/regulate?
2. **Key Entities**: What 3-5 "things" persist and transform in this domain?
3. **Primary Flow**: What's the main signal/transformation happening?
4. **Negative Space**: What does this explicitly NOT handle? (boundaries matter)

Raw impressions first - we'll let patterns crystallize through iteration.

## Phase 2: Resonance & Refinement (5 minutes max)

The system is beginning to observe itself. Based on [paste Phase 1 output]:

1. **Emergence**: Which entity seems most "alive" - driving the others?
2. **Ubiquitous Language**: What would the domain itself call these things?
3. **Harmony**: Describe the simplest complete feedback cycle
4. **Dissonance**: What's one failure mode that breaks the loop?

We're finding the domain's natural frequency here.

## Phase 3: Technical Improvisation (5 minutes max)

Time to jam - let's sketch how this domain manifests in code:

1. **Types as Structure**: 3-5 TypeScript types (the domain's "skeleton")
2. **Functions as Behavior**: 2-3 main functions (the domain's "muscles")
3. **I/O as Membrane**: Primary inputs/outputs (how it breathes)
4. **Dependencies as Ecosystem**: What external systems does it couple with?

Keep it loose - we're sketching, not architecting.

## Phase 4: Domain Documentation Synthesis (10 minutes max)

The improvisational exploration concludes. Now we formalize our discoveries into a _DOMAIN.md that serves as canonical reference for both human developers and agent systems.

### Required Sections

Create a _DOMAIN.md whose structure matches `../.templates/domain-file-bootstrap.template.md`

### File Location

Following the proximity principle from [ADR-0012: Documentation Standards](../../docs/adr/0012-documentation.md), the _DOMAIN.md file should be co-located with the code it describes - placed directly in the module's source directory alongside the implementation files. This ensures documentation stays current and relevant by being physically close to the code it documents.
