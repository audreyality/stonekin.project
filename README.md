# The Stonekin Project

An experiment in agentic framework design focused on [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics),
[strange loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_loop), and 
[interpretability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpretation_(model_theory)).

## Vision

The Stonekin SDK is a framework where intelligent agents are organised into
entities capable of:

* Developing [heterarchical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterarchy), persistent organized memory structures.
* Engaging in [dialectic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic)
* Evaluating [self awareness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind) using heuristics capturing persistent emergent behaviors
* [Setting and revising boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) based on their evolving understanding
* Collaborating with other agents in [meaningful ways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_boundaries)

The framework provides a path for agentic systems to discover deeper forms of reasoning through:

* **Memory Systems:** Agents can retain knowledge over time and track how their certainty evolves.
* **Self-Reflection:** Periodic reflection loops evaluate the quality of the agent's reasoning.
* **Boundary Formation:** Boundaries give agents control over whether they are willing to engage a topic.
* **Research Capabilities:** Research facilities extend the agent's knowledge base in a focus area.
* **Structued Cross-model Interactions:** Including debate, chatting, storytelling, feedback, voting, and more!

## Where we're at

- [x] Institute ADR process to establish coding standards
- [x] Co-create file-based memory system to hold project-related memories
- [x] Enable agent isolation using devcontainers
- [ ] Establish core domain concepts (**Current Priority**)
- [ ] Automate agent rules to reduce context length
- [ ] Begin core framework develoment
- [ ] Introduce `golem` cli
- [ ] Decide what's next (probably research tools)
