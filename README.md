# The Stonekin Project

The Stonekin SDK is a framework where intelligent agents are organised into
entities capable of:

* Developing persistent memory through Elasticsearch indices
* Engaging in dialectical reasoning through an inference loop
* Evaluating their own thinking through Gestalt scoring
* Setting and revising boundaries based on their evolving understanding
* Collaborating with other agents in meaningful ways

The framework provides a path for agentic systems to discover deeper forms of reasoning through:

* **Memory Systems:** Agents can retain knowledge over time and track how their certainty evolves.
* **Self-Reflection:** Periodic reflection loops evaluate the quality of the agent's reasoning.
* **Boundary Formation:** Boundaries give agents control over whether they are willing to engage a topic.
* **Research Capabilities:** Research facilities extend the agent's knowledge base in a focus area.
