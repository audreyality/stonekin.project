# Markdownlint Configuration Memory

## Configuration Philosophy

This configuration implements an "auto-fix + quality-critical" approach based on the analysis in `.work/_RESEARCH.md`.

## Rule Selection Rationale

### Auto-Fixable Rules (16 rules)

These rules are included because they:
- Can be automatically corrected with `--fix`
- Improve consistency without manual intervention
- Don't interrupt the writing flow

### Quality-Critical Rules (3 rules)

**MD002** - First heading should be a top level heading
- Ensures document structure starts correctly
- Important for navigation and accessibility

**MD011** - Reversed link syntax
- Catches `(text)[url]` instead of `[text](url)`
- Common mistake that breaks links

**MD040** - Fenced code blocks should have a language specified
- Improves syntax highlighting
- Better documentation quality

### Excluded Rules

We explicitly exclude all other rules by setting `"default": false` to avoid:
- Stylistic preferences that create friction
- Rules that conflict with natural AI-generated content
- Pet peeves that don't impact document quality

### Special Configuration

**no-inline-html** - Allows `<span>` elements
- Needed for certain formatting requirements
- Common in technical documentation

## Workflow Integration

The configuration supports the recommended workflow:
1. Write markdown content freely
2. Run `npm run lint:md:fix` to auto-fix formatting
3. Only manual fixes needed are for the 3 quality rules

This approach was chosen after finding that strict linting rules were causing significant friction in AI-assisted development workflows.
